So this will be a website with a few pages.

We'll have a page with the males and females, a home page, about, breeding garuntee, contact us?

There is a logo its on their facebook page.

They want the main colors to be black and white.


# Research

Every website nowadays had that stupid nav bar at the top.
- For mobile websites the nav bar is often collapsed into a menu.
    - It seems that a common technique is whenever the screen is small have it display vertically and horizontally on larger screens.
    - Luckily css can handle this for us
        - @media screen and (max-width: 600px)
        - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp
- I did find one website that just straight up gave the user the desktop verison though. (BAD IDEA)

For breeders that have multiple breeds they do a section for each breed.

Will want the date of birth, the gender, name, picture of the dog, and a way to contact on the page.

A blog has appeared on some.

Generally the entire page is not used rather its more like 50-75% of it.

Big 3 pages are home, about, and contact.

Reviews section if possibler would be nice.

Domain Name: AirdalesofSouthernROC.com

Writing the website with wordpress seems like it's going to be the choice as most the simplest options that include a domain
do wordpress.
