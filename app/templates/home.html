                    Southern realizes when she is a little girl that she will dedicate her life to breeding dogs. After
                    all,
                    it
                    is in her blood; she grew up with dogs in her father's kennel in the swamps of Alabama. A business
                    woman
                    who
                    with her husband has devoted over 30 years of her life to breeding Airedale Terriers, specializing
                    over
                    time
                    on a unique breed --- a Black Airedale. The growing acclaim of their Black Airedales is interrupted
                    as
                    they
                    face an intimidating fight against intimidation and slander from competing breeders and the greed
                    and
                    corruption of lawyers and large socio-educational clubs. They are forced to defend their reputation
                    and
                    her
                    career and their beloved dogs in the competitive world of dog breeding.
