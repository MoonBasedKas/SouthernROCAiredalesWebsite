FORCE THIS WEBSITE TO BE A HTTPS CONNECTION IF POSSIBLE. IF YOU ARE NOT ON A HTTPS CONNECTION DO NOT LOG IN.

Okay most of this website is easy to get set up and running you will need to modify the .env file to be the following.
user=
password=
host=127.0.0.1
port=3306
database=SouthernROC
You'll need to fill in the uesr and password section for the database connection. I'm not sure where the .env will be opened that seems to kind of 
varry. But the .env should be in whatever directory you are executing from.

If you have to modify the .env's file location you may have to modify line 10 from app.py
folderpath = ""
Put the new path to the apps directory from where you are running there.
